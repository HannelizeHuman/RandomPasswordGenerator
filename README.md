# RandomPasswordGenerator

## Description
The objective of this assignment was to create an application, using starter code, that will generate a random password that is dependant on what criteria the user enters. The user will be presented with a series of five questions:

1. The lenth of the password. They have to choose a number between 8 - 128.
2. Should the password contain numbers?
3. Should the password contain special characters?
4. Should the password contain upper case letters?
5. Should the password contain lower case letters?

They will have to write a number between 8 - 128 and there after would have to select at least one of the no 2 to no 5 questions.

The password generator will present the user with a password, which they then can click on and this will copy to their clipboard. This allows them to copy and paste the password where they so choose.
